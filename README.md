Put static pages in the `frontend/pages/` directory.

They will be available at uris like this:

  http://your.domain.org/your_as/static/page

Example: The plugin ships with a file called `moo.html`. This would be served at:

  http://your.domain.org/your_as/static/moo.html


Somethings to improve:

  - Stream the file
  - Handle file format correctly
  - Other stuff!
